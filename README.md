# Proximal Policy Optimization in Action: Real-Time Pricing with Trust-Region Learning
A Practical Guide to Actor–Critic Methods for Dynamic, Data-Driven Decisions
Every time a customer opens an app or website, the platform must set a surcharge in milliseconds to balance rider supply, demand spikes, and weather. Simple if-then rules can't adapt fast enough, while naive trial-and-error risks wasted revenue or angry customers. This paper shows how Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) - a modern reinforcement learning method - can learn smooth, real-time pricing policies that are both adaptive and stable.
We begin with a simple explanation of PPO: how clipping the policy update keeps learning steady, avoids overreaction, and works efficiently using first-order gradients. We walk through each core step - data collection, advantage estimation, clipped update, value training, and entropy regularization - and show why PPO outperforms basic policy gradient and Actor–Critic methods.
Next, we apply PPO to a real-world case: 15-minute dynamic delivery surcharges. Using actual logs, we build a custom environment and compare PPO with a standard Actor–Critic baseline. We analyze performance across revenue, penalties, and pricing patterns - and find that PPO leads to more balanced and reliable fee decisions.
We also step back to explore where PPO fits in the broader business landscape. Beyond delivery surcharges, any scenario that requires fast and reliable decision-making - like real-time ad bidding, dynamic pricing, inventory control, or warehouse robotics - can benefit from PPO's unique mix of stability and flexibility.
By the end of this paper, you'll have a clear understanding of both the theory and practical use of PPO, along with code examples and a roadmap for applying it to real-time decision systems.
